# 3D Bot
The bot has 3 controllable joint angles: the hip, knee, and body. </br>

## Joints
The 'h’ key controls the hip, ‘k’ controls the knee, and ‘b’ controls the body. </br>

Select a joint and then use the arrow keys to change the specified joint angle in both directions. </br>

## Cannon
The cannon can be animated with the ‘c’ key and stopped with the ‘C’ key. </br>

## Walk Animation
One of the bot's legs is also animated to simulate a walking cycle (one step). </br>

Use the ‘w’ key to start the cycle and 'W' to reset the joint angles. </br>
